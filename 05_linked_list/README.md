**Linked List**  
insertFirst, deleteFirst `O(1)`   
find, insert, delete `O(N)`  
(but faster than the same operations in _array_, because _linked list_ doesn't require replacement of elements.   
_Linked list_ can be much faster if copying takes a considerable amount of time)  

**Sorted linked list**  
insert, delete `O(N)` (average `O(N/2)`)  
findFirst, deleteFirst `O(1)`
